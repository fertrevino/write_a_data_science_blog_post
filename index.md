### Introduction
Software development is becoming more popular every year. More and more people are interested in starting a career in this field. Others who are already working in this field, are curious about the global trends in this technology sector. Hence the Stackoverflow survey results are of interest for newcomers and expereinced programmers.

What can we learn? After a meta analysis of the results, I have concluded that the following questions can be answered by analyzing the data programatically. Check out the Github [repository](https://github.com/fertrevino/write_a_data_science_blog_post) containing all the code used for this analysis.

In this post, we will answer the following questions using the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM).

1. What are the most popular programming languages in different countries? 
2. What is the correlation between programming language, experience and salary?
3. What is the most popular occupation for the respondents?
